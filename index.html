### Intelligence System for Digital Fashion & Perfect Fit

> **The end of clothes that don’t fit.**  
> TRYONYOU is a fashion intelligence system combining **AI, digital avatars, smart wardrobes, and biometric payments** to transform how people choose, try, and buy clothing.

## 🌍 Vision

The fashion industry loses billions every year due to:
- Product returns  
- Poor purchasing experiences  
- Clothes that are never worn  

**TRYONYOU exists to eliminate this problem at its root.**

Our mission is simple:  
👉 **People should only buy clothes that truly fit them**, at the right moment, for the right context, without friction.

- 🧍 **3D Digital Avatar**  
  A body-accurate digital representation for realistic virtual try-ons.

- 👗 **Wardrobe Intelligence**  
  A smart digital wardrobe that understands what you own, what you wear, and what suits you best.

- 📊 **PAU – Personal Analytics Unit**  
  Continuous learning of personal style, habits, and preferences.
