## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Consistency is Key:** Use the same seed number when generating all three outfit variations to maintain the same model, pose, and lighting.

2. **Iterate:** Generate 3-5 versions of each outfit and select the best one.

3. **Pau Attention:** If Pau doesn't appear correctly, emphasize the peacock element earlier in the prompt or adjust the size percentage.

4. **Reference Images:** Keep Vogue or Harper's Bazaar covers nearby for style inspiration and quality comparison.

5. **Lighting Check:** Ensure Pau's lighting matches the model's - this is critical for realism.

6. **Background Balance:** The gradient should be subtle enough not to distract but defined enough to separate the figure.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Pau doesn't appear
- Move the Pau description earlier in the prompt
- Add "IMPORTANT:" or "CRITICAL:" before Pau specifications
- Try "white peacock mascot visible in bottom-right corner"

### Pau is too large/small
- Adjust the percentage: 8% for smaller, 12% for larger
- Be explicit: "small mascot size, approximately 10% of image height"

### Pau's lighting doesn't match
- Emphasize: "same soft cinematic lighting as the model"
- Add: "consistent shadows and highlights with main scene"

### Model inconsistency between variations
- Use the same seed/generation parameters
- Keep the core model description identical
- Only change the outfit section

### Wrong aspect ratio
- Explicitly state: "9:16 vertical format"
- For some platforms, use --ar 9:16 or select "Tall" format
