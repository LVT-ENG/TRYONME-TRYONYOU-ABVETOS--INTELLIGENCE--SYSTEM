# Google Platform News

Recent updates and roadmap integration plans for Google Platforms, highlighting key advancements in AI models, developer tools, and creative generation.

## Gemini 3 Pro

**Rolled out to Jules (Dec 2025)**

Gemini 3 Pro is Google's most intelligent model, now integrated into Jules, the always-on autonomous coding agent.

*   **Capabilities**: Surpasses Gemini 2.5 Pro in coding, mastering agentic workflows and complex zero-shot tasks.
*   **Improvements**:
    *   **Clearer Reasoning**: Better handling of multi-step tasks.
    *   **Stronger Intent Alignment**: Understands user goals more accurately.
    *   **Reliability**: Significant lift in day-to-day reliability for complex tasks.
*   **Availability**: Rolling out to Google AI Ultra and Pro subscribers.

## Jules

**The Always-On Autonomous Coding Agent**

Jules has been updated to integrate Gemini 3 Pro, expanding its capabilities and surface area.

*   **Integration**: Powered by Gemini 3 Pro for enhanced reasoning and context maintenance.
*   **New Surfaces**:
    *   **Jules Tools**: Terminal integration.
    *   **Gemini CLI Extension**: Access Jules directly from the command line.
    *   **Jules API**: Stable API for custom workflows and automation.
*   **Features**:
    *   **Parallel Runs**: Support for parallel execution in CLI.
    *   **Diff Viewer**: Review changes before applying them.
    *   **Windows Support**: Improved compatibility.
    *   **Critic Agent**: Re-engages more reliably to keep tasks on track.

## Veo 3.1

**Advanced Video Generation Model**

Veo 3.1 introduces significant upgrades in video quality, audio generation, and creative control.

*   **Audio**: Richer native audio, including conversations and synchronized sound effects.
*   **New Capabilities**:
    *   **Ingredients to Video**: Use up to 3 reference images to guide generation, ensuring character and style consistency.
    *   **Scene Extension**: Create longer videos by generating new clips based on the final second of the previous clip.
    *   **First and Last Frame**: Generate smooth transitions between a specific starting and ending image.
*   **Availability**: Paid preview in Gemini API (Google AI Studio and Vertex AI).

## Antigravity

**Agentic IDE**

"Antigravity" (Google's new agentic IDE based on VS Code) focuses on integrating AI agents deeply into the development workflow.

*   **Core**: Based on VS Code.
*   **Agent Manager**: Manage and orchestrate AI agents.
*   **Artifacts**: Dynamic primitives generated by the model.
*   **Chrome Integration**: Allows for computer use and video recording of agent actions, enabling end-to-end testing and automation.

## Conductor

**Context-Driven Development for AI-Assisted Coding**

Conductor is an open-source extension for the Gemini CLI designed to solve the "context window" problem in long-running AI coding sessions.

*   **Problem Solved**: Addresses the "20-message problem" where AI loses context of architectural decisions and constraints.
*   **Method**: Uses markdown files committed to the repository to maintain state:
    *   `product.md`: Project goals and features.
    *   `techstack.md`: Technology constraints and choices.
    *   `tracks.md`: Work history and active tasks.
    *   `plan.md`: Current execution plan.
*   **Workflow**:
    1.  **Setup (Interview)**: Understands the project.
    2.  **Planning (Deliberation)**: Creates a plan before coding.
    3.  **Execution (Implementation)**: Executes the approved plan.
