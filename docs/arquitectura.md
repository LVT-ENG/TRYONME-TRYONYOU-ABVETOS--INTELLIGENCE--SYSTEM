# System Architecture

## Introduction

The TRYONME-TRYONYOU-ABVETOS-INTELLIGENCE-SYSTEM is a modular and scalable platform designed to revolutionize the fashion industry. It combines advanced technologies such as 3D modeling, artificial intelligence, and biometric security to provide a seamless and personalized virtual try-on experience.

## Core Principles

- **Modularity**: The system is composed of independent yet interconnected modules, allowing for flexibility and scalability.
- **Intelligence**: AI is at the core of the platform, powering everything from personalized recommendations to trend forecasting.
- **User-Centricity**: The user is at the center of the experience, with a focus on personalization, convenience, and security.
- **Sustainability**: The platform promotes a more sustainable fashion ecosystem through features like the Solidarity Wardrobe.

## System Components

The system is divided into several key components, each responsible for a specific set of functionalities:

### 1. Frontend Application

The frontend is a web-based application built with Vite and React. It provides the user interface for interacting with the platform, including:

- 3D avatar creation and customization
- Virtual try-on interface
- Intelligent wardrobe management
- Secure biometric payments

### 2. Backend Services

The backend is composed of a set of microservices that provide the core functionalities of the platform. These services are responsible for:

- **`avatar3D.js`**: 3D avatar generation and management
- **`comparadorTextil.js`**: Intelligent garment comparison and fitting
- **`recomendadorPAU.js`**: Emotional and personalized recommendations
- **`pagoAVBET.js`**: Secure biometric payments
- **`autoDonate.js`**: Automated donations to the Solidarity Wardrobe
- **`botsInternos.js`**: Internal automation and assistance

### 3. Intelligent Agents

The platform is powered by a suite of 50 intelligent agents that automate and optimize various aspects of the fashion lifecycle. These agents are organized into functional blocks, as described in the [Agent Documentation](agentes.md).

### 4. External APIs

The system integrates with various external APIs to provide a comprehensive set of features, including:

- **`apiClient.js`**: Connection to external APIs such as EPCT/WIPO, Shopify, and Amazon.

## Data Flow

The data flows through the system as follows:

1. The user interacts with the frontend application to create an avatar, try on clothes, and make purchases.
2. The frontend communicates with the backend services to perform the requested actions.
3. The backend services interact with the intelligent agents and external APIs to provide the required functionalities.
4. The data is stored in a secure and scalable database.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Vite, React
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **AI**: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Deployment**: Vercel
