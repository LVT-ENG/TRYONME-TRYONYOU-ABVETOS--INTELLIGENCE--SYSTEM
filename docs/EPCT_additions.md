# EPCT Additions (TRYONYOU – ABVETOS – ULTRA-PLUS-ULTIMATUM)

## Summary of the Invention (adapted)
The invention further comprises a context engineering orchestration layer configured to integrate heterogeneous modules into a unified interaction flow. Said layer dynamically curates information from multiple subsystems (emotional recommender, creative auto-production, dual-biometric payment, wardrobe modules, fashion trend tracker, deploy manager) and injects only the relevant fragments into the context window of the conversational or agent-based interface. This ensures optimal personalization, reduced computational overhead, and secure integration across all components.

## Detailed Description
In one embodiment, the system includes a context curation engine (ABVETOS), implemented as a middleware process, which:
• Receives user requests and the system instructions.
• Aggregates state information from the following modules:
  • PAU (emotional recommender): providing emotional signals and trend-based inputs.
  • CAP (Creative Auto-Production): providing design and pattern files when catalog garments are insufficient.
  • ABVET (dual biometric payment): providing biometric validation status (iris + voice).
  • Smart Wardrobe and Solidarity Wardrobe: providing garment ownership history, sharing, and donation records.
  • FTT (Fashion Trend Tracker): providing real-time external trend data.
  • Deploy Express Manager: providing operational deployment status and commit history.
• Performs curation and selection, limiting the injected information to those elements directly relevant to the user query.
• Transmits the curated context to the processing engine (language model or intelligent agent), which generates an output response.
• Stores persistent memory of user parameters (measurements, preferences, restrictions such as “rear darts in shirts” and “non-transparent pockets in trousers”).

## Problem–Solution Statement (EPO format)
Closest prior art: virtual try-on and recommender systems limited to catalog-only garments without unified context.
Objective technical problem: how to orchestrate heterogeneous modules (avatar, production, payment, wardrobe, trend analysis) in real time without overloading the interaction engine.
Solution: providing a context engineering layer that curates, prioritizes, and injects relevant module data into the agent’s context window, ensuring coherent, secure, and efficient multi-module integration.

## Claims (proposed additions)
Claim X. A system according to any of the preceding claims, further comprising a context engineering layer configured to:
• aggregate inputs from a plurality of fashion, payment, and production modules;
• curate and select only relevant fragments; and
• inject said fragments into a context window for processing by an intelligent agent.

Claim X+1. The system of claim X, wherein the context engineering layer is implemented as ABVETOS middleware, interfacing with modules PAU, CAP, ABVET, Smart/Solidarity Wardrobes, FTT, and Deploy Express Manager.

Claim X+2. The system of claim X, wherein the context engineering layer maintains persistent memory of user parameters and applies them automatically in subsequent sessions.
