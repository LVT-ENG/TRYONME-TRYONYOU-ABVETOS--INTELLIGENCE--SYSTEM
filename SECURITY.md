# Security Policy

## ðŸš¨ Critical Security Alert

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**: GitHub tokens have been found exposed in this repository. 

### If you are the repository owner:
1. **IMMEDIATELY REVOKE** any GitHub tokens that may have been exposed
2. Generate new tokens through GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens
3. Update your CI/CD pipelines and any applications using the old tokens
4. Review access logs for any unauthorized usage

## ðŸ”’ Security Guidelines

### Never Commit Sensitive Data
- **NEVER** commit API keys, tokens, passwords, or any sensitive credentials
- Use environment variables and `.env` files (which should be in `.gitignore`)
- Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD workflows
- Use secure secret management services for production

### Token Patterns to Avoid
The following patterns should NEVER appear in your code:
- `ghp_*` (GitHub Personal Access Tokens)
- `github_pat_*` (GitHub Fine-grained Personal Access Tokens)
- `gho_*`, `ghu_*`, `ghs_*`, `ghr_*` (Other GitHub tokens)
- `sk-*` (OpenAI API keys)
- `AKIA*` (AWS Access Keys)

### Best Practices
1. **Use `.env.example` files** with placeholder values
2. **Add comprehensive `.gitignore` patterns** for sensitive files
3. **Use GitHub's secret scanning** alerts
4. **Regularly rotate tokens and keys**
5. **Implement least-privilege access** for all tokens
