# TRYONYOU - Virtual Fitting Room (Pilot)

**Version**: Nov/Dec 2025 Edition
**Status**: Active Pilot

## 🚀 Powered by Google Platform (New Releases)

This project leverages the latest advancements from Google's AI ecosystem released in late 2025:

*   **Gemini 3 Pro**: Foundational multimodal intelligence powering our "Master Brain".
*   **Veo 3.1**: Generative video engine for hyper-realistic fabric simulation and dynamic content.
*   **Antigravity**: Serverless infrastructure ensuring infinite scalability for biometric processing.
*   **Jules**: The autonomous coding agent responsible for maintaining and evolving this repository.
*   **Conductor**: AI Orchestration layer managing 53 specialized agents.

## 📄 Project Overview

TRYONYOU eliminates returns and sizing guesswork by using advanced computer vision and AI to match users with their perfect fit. The "Pilot" phase focuses on biometric accuracy and physics-based matching rather than just visual overlay.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
*   **Backend**: Python (Serverless Functions via Vercel)
*   **AI/ML**: Google Gemini 3 Pro, MediaPipe, OpenCV
*   **Infrastructure**: Google Cloud Antigravity (simulated via Vercel/Cloudflare in Pilot)

## 📦 Installation & Setup

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
3.  Run development server: `npm run dev`

## 🤖 Agents

*   **Agent 001 (PAU)**: Personal Assistant Unit.
*   **Agent 015**: Drape-Aware Physics Engine.
*   **Agent 31/02/25**: Content generation agents for Video, Content, and Images.
