# Workflow Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Build Command Mismatch
- **Problem**: Scripts were using `npx vite build` but the project uses Next.js
- **Solution**: Updated all scripts to use `npm run build` which runs `next build`

### 2. Missing Dependencies  
- **Problem**: TypeScript dependencies were missing causing Next.js build to fail
- **Solution**: Added `typescript`, `@types/react`, and `@types/node` to apps/web/package.json

### 3. Project Structure Issues
- **Problem**: Mixed Vite/Next.js structure with conflicting main.ts file
- **Solution**: Removed conflicting files and created proper Next.js pages structure

### 4. Vercel Configuration
- **Problem**: vercel.json was configured for static builds but project uses Next.js
- **Solution**: Updated to use `@vercel/next` builder instead of `@vercel/static`

### 5. Missing GitHub Actions
- **Problem**: No `.github/workflows` directory existed
- **Solution**: Created proper GitHub Actions workflow with correct build steps

## Verification

✅ `npm run build` works correctly  
✅ `npm run dev` starts development server  
✅ Next.js generates optimized production build  
✅ No TypeScript compilation errors  
✅ Build artifacts excluded from git via .gitignore  

## Usage

To build the project:
```bash
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run build
```

To run development server:
```bash
cd apps/web
npm run dev
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy to Vercel when code is pushed to the main branch (requires VERCEL_TOKEN secret to be configured in GitHub repository settings).
