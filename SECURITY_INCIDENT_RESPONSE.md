# 🚨 SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE - GITHUB TOKEN EXPOSURE

## Incident Summary
**Date**: January 2025  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Issue**: GitHub Personal Access Tokens exposed in repository files  
**Status**: REMEDIATED ✅

## Exposed Tokens (REQUIRE IMMEDIATE REVOCATION)
The following tokens were found exposed in the repository:
- `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` (found in multiple files)
- Token from issue description: `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`

## Immediate Actions Taken ✅
1. **Removed sensitive files**:
   - ❌ Deleted `tokens` file
   - ❌ Deleted `api key` file
   
2. **Sanitized configuration files**:
   - 🔧 Fixed `legacy/AVBETOS_repo_package/.env.example` (replaced real tokens with placeholders)
   
3. **Enhanced security measures**:
   - 🛡️ Updated `.gitignore` with comprehensive token patterns
   - 📚 Updated `SECURITY.md` with security guidelines
   - 📋 Created this incident response document

## Required Actions by Repository Owner

### IMMEDIATE (Do Now)
- [ ] **REVOKE ALL EXPOSED TOKENS** via GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens
- [ ] **CHECK ACCESS LOGS** for any unauthorized usage of these tokens
- [ ] **REVIEW REPOSITORY ACCESS** - ensure only authorized users have access

### SHORT TERM (Next 24 hours)
- [ ] **Generate new tokens** if needed (with minimal required permissions)
- [ ] **Update any CI/CD systems** that may have been using the old tokens
- [ ] **Notify team members** about the security incident
- [ ] **Review other repositories** for similar exposure

### ONGOING
- [ ] **Enable GitHub secret scanning** alerts
- [ ] **Implement pre-commit hooks** to prevent future token commits
- [ ] **Regular security audits** of repository contents
- [ ] **Team security training** on secure development practices

## Verification Steps
✅ No GitHub tokens found in current repository files  
✅ All .env.example files use placeholder values  
✅ Enhanced .gitignore prevents future exposure  
✅ GitHub Actions workflows use proper secrets management  

## Prevention Measures Implemented
1. **Enhanced .gitignore patterns** for tokens and sensitive files
2. **Security documentation** with clear guidelines
3. **Placeholder values** in all example configuration files
4. **Incident response documentation** for future reference

**Note**: This incident has been fully remediated from a repository perspective, but token revocation by the repository owner is still required to complete the security response.
