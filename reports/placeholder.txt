# Reports Directory

This directory is used to store logs and reports generated by automation scripts.

## Contents

Generated files include:
- Fusion summary reports (JSON format)
- Deployment logs
- PDF reports (when applicable)
- Execution timestamps and status

## File Structure

Reports are automatically created by the automation scripts when they execute.
The main fusion report is generated as `fusion-summary.json` containing:
- Timestamp of execution
- List of merged repositories
- Target domain
- Execution status

## Maintenance

This directory is automatically managed by the automation system.
Old reports may be archived periodically to maintain performance.
